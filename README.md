# PasswordGenerator
Homework # 3

Goal was to create an application that generates a random password based on user selected criteria.  At this point I have been able to achomplish this.  The user interface has not been updated or its responsiveness to multiple screen sizes.  This will be worked on as soon as possible

The application uses user "prompt" to gather information required to determine the length of the password.  It also uses "confirms" to identify the desired character types to use for the password.  "If" Statements were used to identify if the desired parameters required from the user were met.  If not the user is notified by an "Alert" and is then directed to the begining of the series of prompts and confirms.
